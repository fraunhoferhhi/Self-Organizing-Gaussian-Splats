### Code

This repository is a fork of the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering".

The code for "Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids" consists of multiple parts. The multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, PLAS, is available under the Apache License at [fraunhoferhhi/PLAS](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS).

The integration of the sorting, the smoothness regularization and the compression code for training and compressing 3D scenes is available in this repository.

## Cloning the Repository

The repository contains submodules, thus please check it out with

```shell
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians.git --recursive
```

or

```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians.git --recursive
```

## Python Environment

The code is using a few additional Python packages on top of graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting. We provide an extended environment.yml:

Installation with [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html):

```shell
micromamba env create --file environment.yml --channel-priority flexible -y
micromamba activate sogs
```

## Example training

Download a dataset, e.g. [T&T](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip).

The train.py script expects a name to a .yaml config file in the [config/](config/) folder. All parameters for the run are by default loaded from the yaml file. An example launch file can be found in .vscode/launch.json, for launching from Visual Studio Code.

Example:

```shell
python train.py \
  --config-name ours_q_sh_local_test \
  hydra.run.dir=/data/output/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}-${run.name} \
  dataset.source_path=/data/gaussian_splatting/tandt_db/tandt/truck \
  run.no_progress_bar=false \
  run.name=vs-code-debug
```

The parameter configurations can be overriden in the launch as shown (using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)).

## Pre-Trained Models & Evaluation

Trained and compressed scenes are available for download in the [ECCV 2024 release](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/releases/tag/eccv-2024-data).

The script at [eval/download_eval.sh](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/blob/main/eval/download_eval.sh) will automatically:
* download the pre-trained scenes with and without spherical harmonics
* measure size on disk and number of Gaussians of the compressed scenes
* decompress the scenes into .ply
* render the test images for each scene, using the original 3DGS code
* compute the metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) for all test images
* gather the results in .csv, in the format of the [3DGS compression survey](https://w-m.github.io/3dgs-compression-survey/)

The evaluation results can be found in [results/](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/blob/main/results/).

## Differences with graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting

Code differences can be found in this diff: https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/pull/1/files

### Usage

- different command-line interface for train.py (using Hydra)
- wandb.ai used for logging

### Code extensions

- post-training quantization, compression/decompression
- xyz log activation (gaussian_model.py)
- grid sorting, neighbor loss (gaussian_model.py)
- option to disable spherical harmonics

## Updates

- 2024-11-28: Add [ECCV 2024 Redux Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb5U9xfx7-w), [View Dependent Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0O6R0Keywg) and proceedings .bib to project page.
- 2024-10-30: Update project page with reduction factors from updated metric computation -> 19.9x to 39.5x compression over 3DGS.
- 2024-09-16: Script to compute per-scene metrics from uploaded models (see *Pre-Trained Models & Evaluation*). This fixes issues in the metric computation, previously done from Weights & Biases runs: *Dr Johnson* now correctly attributed to DeepBlending dataset (was: *T&T*); Quality loss from quantization and compression losses correctly incorporated.
- 2024-08-22: Released pre-trained, [compressed scenes](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/releases/tag/eccv-2024-data)
