### Code

This repository is a fork of the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering".

The code for "Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids" consists of multiple parts. The multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, PLAS, is available under the Apache License at [fraunhoferhhi/PLAS](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS).

The integration of the sorting, the smoothness regularization and the compression code for training and compressing 3D scenes is available in this repository.

## Cloning the Repository

The repository contains submodules, thus please check it out with

```shell
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians.git --recursive
```

or

```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians.git --recursive
```

## Python Environment

The code is using a few additional Python packages on top of graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting. We provide an extended environment.yml:

Installation with [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html):
```
conda env create --file environment.yml --yes
conda activate sogs
```

[Since conda 23.10.0 libmamba is the default solver](https://conda.org/blog/2023-11-06-conda-23-10-0-release/). But if you have an older installation, [make sure that the libmamba solver is set](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community).   

Alternative installation with [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html):

```shell
micromamba env create --file environment.yml --channel-priority flexible -y
micromamba activate sogs
```

## Example training

Download a dataset, e.g. [T&T](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip).

The train.py script expects a name to a .yaml config file in the [config/](config/) folder. All parameters for the run are by default loaded from the yaml file. An example launch file can be found in .vscode/launch.json, for launching from Visual Studio Code.

Example in bash:

```shell
python train.py \
  --config-name ours_q_sh_local_test \
  hydra.run.dir=/data/output/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}-${run.name} \
  dataset.source_path=/data/gaussian_splatting/tandt_db/tandt/truck \
  run.no_progress_bar=false \
  run.name=vs-code-debug
```

Example in powershell:
```shell
python train.py `
  --config-name ours_q_sh_local_test `
  hydra.run.dir=/data/output/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${now:%H-%M-%S}-${run.name} `
  dataset.source_path="absolute\path\to\your\data\tandt_db\tandt\truck" `
  run.no_progress_bar=false `
  run.name=vs-code-debug
```

The parameter configurations can be overriden in the launch as shown (using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)).

## Differences with graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting

Code differences can be found in this diff: https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians/pull/1/files

### Usage

- different command-line interface for train.py (using Hydra)
- wandb.ai used for logging

### Code extensions

- post-training quantization, compression/decompression
- xyz log activation (gaussian_model.py)
- grid sorting, neighbor loss (gaussian_model.py)
- option to disable spherical harmonics
